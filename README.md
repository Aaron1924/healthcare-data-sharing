# Decentralized Healthcare Data Sharing (BASE Sepolia Testnet)

This project implements a decentralized healthcare data sharing system on the BASE Sepolia testnet, using group signatures from the _**pygroupsig**_ library. The system allows for secure storing, sharing, and purchasing of healthcare data with cryptographic guarantees.

## Overview

This system implements three main workflows:

1. **Storing**: Doctors create and sign medical records, which patients encrypt and store on IPFS.
2. **Sharing**: Patients can securely share their records with specific doctors.
3. **Purchasing**: Data buyers can purchase anonymized healthcare data with verification.
4. **Revocation Management**: A dual-control mechanism for opening group signatures in case of disputes, requiring approval from both Group Manager and Revocation Manager.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Streamlit UI**: Web interface for patients, doctors, hospitals, and buyers.
2. **FastAPI Backend**: Handles API requests, cryptographic operations, and blockchain interactions.
3. **IPFS Storage**: Stores encrypted healthcare records.
4. **Smart Contract**: Manages record metadata and purchase escrow on the BASE Sepolia testnet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- BASE Sepolia testnet wallet with test ETH (get from [BASE Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-sepolia-faucet))
- Python 3.9 or later (if running without Docker)
- MCL library (for group signatures, see [MCL Setup](#mcl-setup) section below)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up environment variables in `.env` file:

   ```bash
  copy .env.example la duoc roi
   ```

3. Run the application using one of the following methods:

#### Using Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up
```

#### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start IPFS daemon
docker run -d --name ipfs-node -v ipfs-data:/data/ipfs -p 4001:4001 -p 8080:8080 -p 5001:5001 ipfs/kubo

# Start the backend server
python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
streamlit run app/main.py
```

After running the above commands, access the UI at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Smart Contract

### Deployed Contract

The DataHub contract has already been deployed to the BASE Sepolia testnet with the following details:

- **Contract Address**: [0x7ab1C0aA17fAA544AE2Ca48106b92836A9eeF9a6](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x7ab1C0aA17fAA544AE2Ca48106b92836A9eeF9a6)
- **Group Manager**: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
- **Revocation Manager**: 0x4b42EE1d1AEe8d3cc691661aa3b25D98Dac2FE46

New contributors do NOT need to deploy the contract again. Simply use this address in your `.env` file:

```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x7ab1C0aA17fAA544AE2Ca48106b92836A9eeF9a6
```




## MCL Setup

The pygroupsig library requires the MCL library for cryptographic operations. You can check if MCL is properly set up by running:

```bash
python check_mcl.py
```

If MCL is not set up, the script will guide you through the setup process. Alternatively, you can set it up manually:

1. Clone the MCL repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
   ```

2. Build MCL:
   ```bash
   cd mcl
   cmake -B build .
   make -C build
   ```

3. Set the MCL_LIB_PATH environment variable:
   ```bash
   export MCL_LIB_PATH=$PWD/mcl/build/lib
   ```

4. Add the environment variable to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) to make it permanent:
   ```bash
   echo 'export MCL_LIB_PATH=/path/to/mcl/build/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## IPFS Setup( tao lam docker, xai ipfs desktop thi tu xu nha)

The application uses IPFS for storing encrypted medical records. You can run IPFS in a Docker container:

```bash
# Pull the IPFS Docker image
docker pull ipfs/kubo

# Run IPFS in a Docker container
docker run -d --name ipfs-node -v ipfs-data:/data/ipfs -p 4001:4001 -p 8080:8080 -p 5001:5001 ipfs/kubo
```

You can test the IPFS connection using the provided script:

```bash
python test_ipfs.py
```

## Running the Application
1.Run with Docker

install docker and docker compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To rebuild after making changes:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
2.You can run the application using the provided run.py script:

```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
streamlit run app/main.py
or
python run.py
```
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:8501
- IPFS: http://localhost:5001/webui
This will start all the required services (IPFS, backend, and frontend). You can also run specific components:

```bash
# Start only the backend
python run.py --frontend-only

# Start only the frontend
python run.py --backend-only

# Start without IPFS (if you already have IPFS running)
python run.py --no-ipfs
```

You can also check if the backend components are working correctly:

```bash
python check_backend.py
```

## pygroupsig Library

### Compilation

This library has been developed from scratch in Python _except_ for **mcl**.
We have built a wrapper around the original [mcl](https://github.com/herumi/mcl)
library written in C/C++ using Python ctypes.

> The library has type hints to ease the development of new schemes. If you encounter
> any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open a PR or
> an issue.
>
> The library was tested in [mcl v2.00](https://github.com/herumi/mcl/tree/v2.00)

## Usage

You can instantiate the different schemes using the `group` class factory or by directly
using the specific class for each scheme:

```python
from pygroupsig import group, GroupBBS04, key, MemberKeyBBS04

## Two variants

# Method1
g = group("bbs04")() # Note: `group` function returns a class, not an instance
# Method2
# g = GroupBBS04()

g.setup()
gk_b64 = g.group_key.to_b64()

# Client side: create a group to use join protocol; you need to set the group_key (public)
gm = group("bbs04")()
gm.group_key.set_b64(gk_b64)

# Method 1
mk = key("bbs04", "member")()
# Method 2
# mk = MemberKeyBBS04()

# Test join protocol that take into account each scheme needs
msg2 = None
seq = gm.join_seq()
for _ in range(0, seq + 1, 2):
    msg1 = g.join_mgr(msg2) # Group manager side
    msg2 = gm.join_mem(msg1, mk) # Member side

s_msg = gm.sign("Hello world!", mk)
v_msg = gm.verify("Hello world!", s_msg["signature"])
```

The functions `setup`, `join_mgr`, `join_mem`, `sign` and `verify` are common to all
schemes. Some schemes also implement additional functionalities:

### BBS04

- open

### PS16

- open
- open_verify

### CPY06

- open
- reveal
- trace
- prove_equality
- prove_equality_verify
- claim
- claim_verify

### KLAP20

- open
- open_verify

### GL19

- blind
- convert
- unblind

### DL21

- identify
- link
- link_verify

### DL21SEQ

- identify
- link
- link_verify
- seqlink
- seqlink_verify

## Tests

### Library Tests

Run the following command to execute the pygroupsig library tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

### System Tests

Run the following command to execute the healthcare data sharing system tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_happy.py
```

This will run through the complete happy path scenario, testing all three workflows (storing, sharing, and purchasing).
